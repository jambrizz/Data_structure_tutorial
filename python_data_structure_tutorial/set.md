# Sets

## Introduction to Sets
A set is a collection of elements that is unique. This has an advantage over arrays when it comes to only
adding unique elements to a collection. This is useful when efficiency and organization is important as
well as when you want to add, remove or query an element in the set.

## How Sets work

## Real world applications
Sets are useful to store unique values to avoid duplicate data being added to a set. By default, sets
stores data in a sorted manner which is more efficient than an array. Sets are dynamic so you do not
need to worry about overflowing the set. The Big O for searching through a set is O(logN). The
implementation of a set can be accomplished using a variety of data structures including TreeSets.

## Example problems

```python
import math
#test
print("Hello")
```
