# Stacks
## What are stacks?
The simplest explanation of what a stack is think of it as a line for an amusemant park ride. When some one decides to stand in the line there is a designated spot where they are placed. Normally in this situation is the back of the line and the person at the front of the line is the first person to get on the ride or "leave the line". This is easy to comprehend because we deal with lines often in our lines and stacks are like that.
