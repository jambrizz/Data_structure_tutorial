# Stacks
## What are stacks?
The simplest explanation of what a stack is think of it as a line for an amusemant park ride. When some one decides to stand in the line there is a designated spot where they are "added". Normally in this situation is the back of the line and the person at the front of the line is the first person to get on the ride or "removed". This is easy to comprehend because we deal with lines often in our lives for example standing in line at the checkout at your local grocery store and stacks are just like that.

The text book definition of a stack is as follows: "A stack is a **linear data structure** in which insertions and deletions are **allowed only at the end**. This is called the **top of the stack**. 

A popular way to remember this concept is the acronym **LIFO** which stand for **"Last In, First Out"**.
