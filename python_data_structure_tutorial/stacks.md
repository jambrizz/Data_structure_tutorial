# Stacks
## What are stacks?
The simplest explanation of what a stack is think of it as a line for an amusemant park ride. When some one decides to stand in the line there is a designated spot where they are "added". Normally in this situation is the back of the line and the person at the front of the line is the first person to get on the ride or "removed". This is easy to comprehend because we deal with lines often in our lives for example standing in line at the checkout at your local grocery store and stacks are just like that.

The text book definition of a stack is as follows: "A stack is a **linear data structure** in which insertions and deletions are **allowed only at the end**. This is called the **top of the stack**. 

A popular way to remember this concept is the acronym **LIFO** which stand for **"Last In, First Out"**. 

## How stacks work
Take a look at the diagram below from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-stack-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/#).

In this diagram you can see that value **"C"** was added by using the common stack operation of **push()** to the top of the stack and when a value was removed **pop()**it was the last value added of **"C"**. Now  let give review a different scenenario, lets say we want to **pop()** value **"B"** from the stack that just had the value of **"C"** added then we would need to **pop()** the value C first then B since we can only remove the last value added to the stack.

A good analogy for how a stack works is say you have a can of pringles and you want to eat a single chip then by design you are forced to eat the top chip in the can and if you wanted to more than just one chip you would have to keep eating the top most chip until you finished all the chips or you decided to stop before reaching the last chip.
