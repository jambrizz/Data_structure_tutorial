# Python Fundamentals Tutorial
Welcome to the python fundamentals tutorial which is meant to be a simple to understand tutorial for beginner programmers using Python. While there is much to cover on the topic of data structures more than can be addressed in this tutorial, I want to focus on three topics which are:

- Stacks
- Sets
- Binary Trees

The modules above will give you an explanation of each topic, How they work, real world applications and an example problem to explain the syntax. Finally a practice problem will be provided to test your understanding of the topic.
