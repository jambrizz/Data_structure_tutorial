# Binary Trees
A binary tree is a data structure where each node has two children and each element in the tree can only have two children.
## Introduction to Binary 
Take a look at the image below from [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-binary-tree-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)

The nopde at the very top of the binary tree is called the root. If a tree is empty the root will be NULL. Binary trees have the following part: data, a pointer to the left child and a pointer to the right child. In this image the root is represented by the number 1. The children of the root are 2 and 3. In binary trees the end nodes are called leaf nodes and in this example they are the numbers 4, 5 , 6 and 7.

|Common Operations|
|:----------------:|
|Inserting elements|
|Reoving elements|
|Searching for an element|
|Deleting an element|
|Traversing|

|Other Operations|
|:---------------:|
|Finding the height of a binary tree|
|Finding the level of the tree|
|Size of the entire binary tree|

## How Binary Trees work
Binary trees are used in many applications including but not limited to:
- Compilers/ Expression Trees
- Data compression algorithmns
- Priority Queue
- Hierarchial data
- Editing software like Microsoft Excel or Google's sheets
- Finding elements
- Memory allocation in computers
- Performing encoding or decoding operations
- Organizing and retrieving data from large data sets.
